# flutt_callback

Showing a colleague how to pass info from child to parent (using a callback function)...

## Notes    
There are comments in the code where the "magic" happens! ;) 

But the keys are:   
* I show how to make a modular, separate child widget   
* this child widget can pass values to the parent   
* the result is re-usable widgets that share state   (cleaner code, easier to understand, moduler, etc.)
